### Capstone: The Evolution of Women's Health News: A New York Times Case Study

**Camilla Santos**

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
The question is important because women’s health is an often underrepresented topic in media coverage and scientific studies so hopefully the project will provide data-driven analysis to offer actionable intelligence to media organizations, health advocates, and companies, creating a roadmap to correct blind spots and better prioritize women's health issues.

#### Research Question
To what extent has the volume, thematic focus, and sentiment of women's health coverage in The New York Times evolved over the past two decades?

#### Data Sources
New York Times Articles from 2024-2024 accessed via the NYT API

#### Methodology
1) Gather the Articles via NYT API
2) Classification: a) With Keyword Classification b) Manual Review of sample datatset and 3) Building a Model w/ TF-IDF and XGBoost 4) Applying the model to the full dataset 
3) Basic Analytics: Volume of Women's Health Articles over time and by news desk
4) Themes Analytics: a) Using Gemini API to interpret the themes of women's health articles

#### Results
So far, I've observed that women's article as a share of total articles has increased over the past 2 decades though still only abour 3% of total NYT articles. And that it is mostly concentrated in news desks like "Well", "Science" and "OpEd". Themes....

#### Next steps
I'd like to try to improve the classification method to a) be more comprehensive and b) remove some off-topic areas like obituaries. 
Also, I want to improve the theme analytics to show trends over time.
